## Refugee -Book review 

The book “Refugee “by Alan Gratz that was published 2017 is a fascinating and young adult literature novel that orbits around three main characters¬¬ -Josef, Isabel, and Mahmoud - from different times: the Nazi period in Germany, Cuba in 1990, and Syria. All three characters will go on terrifying journeys in seeking of refuge. While fleeing their home all of them will endure unimaginable life-threatening dangers- from bombardments to betrayals and disloyalty. But all of them demonstrate incredible resilience, and for each of them there is a hope for tomorrow. 
     
Based on true stories, this book tells about the tragic three period of times in history when refugees were forced to leave their countries. The book reflects experiences of young children who endure terrible events in their fragile ages.  Even though the three separate stories are told in three different voices, I loved how their stories share many similarities and touch each other. My mind is blown by the content and richness of these three characters and their stories.  This book is absolutely phenomenal as it kept me in suspense and highly motivated to read it to the last page. I was amazed and terrified at the same time.  Josef, the Jewish boy, lived with the horrific fear of concentration campus, he witnessed his father being beaten and sent to campus. Isabel is a Cuban girl was set on boat to Miami facing the danger of drowning, hoping to find safety and a welcoming homeland. The distressing story of Mahmoud, the Syrian boy is also terrifying; when a bomb strikes his house, he and his family begin their voyage to Europe hoping they will find refuge. All three characters are exposed to extreme danger and are forced to leave their countries. I was enthralled with this book content and the way the author meticulously gives details. I strongly recommend this book to everyone. 
    
This novel affected me in a very positive way. I came to realization that we, as human beings, need to be emphatic and we need earn the ability to understand and share the feelings other people. I learned that it is very important to support and help people that are put in danger by their own countries and armed conflicts.  While reading this book I was thinking of Syrian war and how innocent people are suffering there. Helping people that are fleeing failed sates must be a shared responsibility of rich states because we never know when a disaster strike in our country. 
          
This book taught me a valuable lesson. I learned to be thankful and I also learned that this book is a great reminder for me to treasure what I have. This book also taught me about the importance of building resilience. Resilience is what gives people strengths to cope with hardship. It taught me that it is important not to dwell on hardship but instead to acknowledge the situation, learn from mistake and move forward. 
        
The book “Refugee’” can be compared with the poem “Partition” by Fatima Asghar. The first part of the poem refers to the event which led to the division of India and the creation of two independent countries, India and Pakistan It is an influential poem about the bloody history of migration. The author talks about horrific history of migration and human suffering as they moved across the border.
