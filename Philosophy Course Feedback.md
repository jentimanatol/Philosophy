# Philosophy Course Feedback

## Dear Professor DeAnna,

I hope this message finds you well. Please let me take a moment to provide some substantial feedback regarding the Philosophy course that I have recently completed. As a computer science student, selecting this course over other available options, such as Astronomy Lab—where I would likely feel more comfortable—was not an easy decision. However, I genuinely value the experience and knowledge I have gained.

### Transition to Philosophy

Transitioning from advanced calculus and physics classes to engaging in philosophical discussions proved to be both challenging and rewarding. In science and engineering, the focus often lies on measurable and provable phenomena backed by complex theories. Philosophy, on the other hand, necessitates an entirely different approach: abstract thinking and deep contemplation about questions that may never have definitive answers. Adapting to this shift in thought processes has been an enriching experience for me.

### Highlights of the Course

What I appreciated most about this course was your decision to expose us to a diverse selection of books rather than relying on a single textbook. This approach introduced us to a variety of perspectives, enriching our understanding and lending our work much more depth than any other class could. In a time when many of us spend more hours on social media than reading books during leisure time, your method helped bridge that gap, making the material engaging and enjoyable.

### Suggestions for Improvement

I would like to suggest incorporating at least one open-themed essay assignment per term without strict limitations on length. This could encourage students to explore their unique philosophical perspectives and potentially reveal hidden talents or innovative ideas. Who knows? The next Socrates might be among us, offering groundbreaking insights into philosophy.

Additionally, while I understand the importance of adhering to deadlines, I found it disheartening when my first assignment was rejected for being late. It felt as though my effort was not appreciated, which was more discouraging than the grade itself. Growing up under a strict educational system in the Soviet Union, I have come to value freedom in creativity, timing, and thematic exploration. Providing flexibility in deadlines—where feasible—could foster a more supportive environment for students who need time to fully develop their ideas.

### Philosophical Growth and Perspective

This course has taught me that embracing our uniqueness and contributing to new movements or leadership is vital in a world where conformity is often the norm. I have learned that everyone possesses a unique philosophical voice deserving of recognition.

The books and discussions throughout the course have profoundly influenced my perspective, allowing me to view the world more broadly and thoughtfully. As an engineering student, I often perceive things through a technical lens; your course has helped lift that veil, granting me a richer, more nuanced understanding.

### Closing Thoughts

Thank you for your time, understanding, and dedication to teaching. You are an exceptional professor, and your efforts have made a lasting impact on my personal and intellectual growth. Wishing you all the best and continued success in your teaching journey.

Sincerely,  
Anatolie Jentimir
