Dear Professor DeAnna

I hope this message finds you well. Please let me take a minute to provide some substantial feedback regarding the Philosophy course that I finally finished. Being a computer science student, selecting this course over other available options, such as Astronomy Lab—where I am sure I'd feel more comfortable—was not an easy choice. Nevertheless, I value the experience and the knowledge I have obtained.

Transitioning from advanced calculus and physics classes to engaging in philosophical discussions was a very challenging yet rewarding experience. In science and engineering, we often focus on what can be measured and proved with complicated theories. Philosophy requires an entirely different approach—one that includes abstract thought and deep contemplation over subjects for which there may never be definite answers. This change in my thought process has been enriching.

I think what I liked about this course most is that you exposed us to several kinds of books instead of one textbook. That fact brought many different ideas into our studies and gave our work much more depth than any other class could ever give. Most of our generation spends more time on social media rather than reading books during our leisure time, and your approach bridged this gap somehow, making the material seem so much more enjoyable.

I would like to suggest that in every assignment, there be at least one essay with a free theme and without strictly limiting length. Maybe in this way, we can reveal some hidden talents or some unusual philosophical ways of considering one thing or another among students. Who knows, maybe the new Socrates is among us with some innovative take on philosophy.

While I understand the importance of deadlines, I found it disheartening that my first assignment was rejected due to being late. It wasn't just about the grade, but more about feeling that my effort was not appreciated. Growing up in the Soviet Union under strict guardianship and experiencing a severe educational upbringing, I have come to value freedom in creativity, timing, and thematic exploration. I have many philosophical thoughts and ideas, but often lack the time to fully implement them.

In a world where conformity is the norm, it is essential for people to embrace their uniqueness and contribute to new movements and leadership. This course has taught me that everyone has a unique philosophical voice that deserves to be heard.

Thank you for your time, understanding, and dedication to teaching. You are a great professor, and throughout the course, I have learned a wealth of new material. The books you recommended have profoundly influenced me, allowing me to see the world from a different perspective. As an engineering major, spending significant time in physics labs often creates a certain lens through which I view things. Your course has helped lift that curtain, allowing me to see things in a broader, more nuanced way.

Wishing you all the best and continued success.

Sincerely, Anatolie Jentimir
