# Introduction to Philosophy

## Course Information
- **Course Code:** PHL 101-01
- **Institution:** Bunker Hill Community College

## Course Description
This course has three principal goals: to expand capacities for deep thinking; to develop skills for understanding and expressing complex ideas; and to consider some profound human questions. Students will encounter a selection of philosophical texts that address enduring philosophical questions. These texts will reflect the chronological, geographical, and social diversity of philosophical inquiry. Students will practice skills for reflective, critical, creative, and integrative thinking, and will demonstrate those skills in understanding and responding to texts, engaging in critical dialogue with peers, inquiring into philosophical questions, and developing and expressing their own philosophical perspectives. This course meets the General Education Requirement for Creative Work.

### Prerequisites:
A grade of C or higher in Academic Reading III (ESL-098) or Integrated ELL Level III (ELL-103) or Reading Skills II (RDG-095) or exemption by placing into a higher-level course.

## Student Learning Outcomes
- Students will consider different schools of philosophical thought, including both Western and Eastern philosophy.
