Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to provide some detailed feedback on the Philosophy course I recently completed. As a computer science student, choosing this course over others such as Astronomy Lab—where I feel more confident—was not an easy decision. However, I am grateful for the experience and the insights I have gained.

Transitioning from advanced calculus and physics classes to engaging in philosophical discussions was challenging yet rewarding. In the fields of science and engineering, we often focus on what is measurable and provable through complex theories. Philosophy, on the other hand, requires a different approach—one that involves abstract thinking and deep contemplation on subjects that may not always have clear answers. This shift in mindset has been a valuable experience for me.

One aspect of the course that I particularly appreciated was the diverse range of books you encouraged us to read. Instead of relying on a single textbook, you exposed us to various perspectives and ideas, which enriched our understanding of the subject matter. Our generation often spends more time on social media than reading books in our free time, and your approach helped bridge this gap by making the material more engaging and accessible.

Regarding the assignments, I would like to suggest including at least one essay with a free theme and no strict length requirement. This flexibility could potentially reveal hidden talents and unique philosophical perspectives among students. You never know, there might be a modern-day Socrates among us with a groundbreaking approach to philosophy.

While I understand the importance of deadlines, I found it disheartening that my first assignment was rejected due to being late. It wasn't just about the grade, but more about feeling that my effort was not appreciated. Growing up in the Soviet Union under strict guardianship and experiencing a severe educational upbringing, I have come to value freedom in creativity, timing, and thematic exploration. I have many philosophical thoughts and ideas, but often lack the time to fully implement them.

In a world where conformity is the norm, it is essential for people to embrace their uniqueness and contribute to new movements and leadership. This course has taught me that everyone has a unique philosophical voice that deserves to be heard.

Thank you for your time, understanding, and dedication to teaching. You are a great professor, and throughout the course, I have learned a wealth of new material. The books you recommended have profoundly influenced me, allowing me to see the world from a different perspective. As an engineering major, spending significant time in physics labs often creates a certain lens through which I view things. Your course has helped lift that curtain, allowing me to see things in a broader, more nuanced way.

Wishing you all the best and continued success.

Sincerely, [Your Name]
